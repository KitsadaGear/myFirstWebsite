            <h1>Stephen Curry</h1>
            <p>
              Stephen Curry, in full Wardell Stephen Curry II, byname Steph,
              (born March 14, 1988, Akron, Ohio, U.S.), American professional
              basketball player who led the Golden State Warriors of the
              National Basketball Association (NBA) to championships in 2014–15,
              2016–17, and 2017–18 and to the best regular-season record in
              league history (73–9) in 2015–16.
            </p>
            <p>
              Curry grew up immersed in basketball as the son of 16-year NBA
              veteran sharpshooter Dell Curry. The younger Curry learned the
              intricacies of the game from his father. His keen shooting and
              high “basketball IQ” were not enough to persuade college coaches
              to overlook his wiry frame and unremarkable 6-foot (1.8-metre)
              height. He did not receive scholarship offers from major college
              basketball programs and attended Davidson (North Carolina) College
            </p>
            <p>
              He then entered the 2009 NBA draft, in which he was selected by
              the Warriors with the seventh overall pick. Curry made an
              immediate impact with the Warriors, becoming the team’s starting
              point guard and averaging 17.5 points per game in his first
              season. and earned his first All-Star selection. In 2014–15 he
              made a then-record 286 three-pointers while leading the Warriors
              to an NBA-best 67–15 record and was named the league’s Most
              Valuable Player (MVP). He
              also topped the NBA with an average of 30.1 points per game and
              shattered his own league standard by making an astounding 402
              three-point shots. Curry earned his second consecutive MVP award
              for his efforts and became the first person to be voted MVP
              unanimously. However, the Warriors’ historic season ultimately
              ended in shocking disappointment as the team surrendered a 3–1 NBA
              finals lead to the Cavaliers.
              <p>
                In 2016–17 Curry led the NBA in three-point field goals made (324) for a fifth straight season as the Warriors again led the NBA in wins (67). The Warriors finally had a postseason loss in game four of the NBA finals, but the team rebounded to defeat the Cavaliers in five games to capture Curry’s second NBA title.
