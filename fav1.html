            <h1>Allen Iverson</h1>
            <p>
              Allen Iverson, in full Allen Ezail Iverson, byname the Answer,
              (born June 7, 1975, Hampton, Virginia, U.S.), American basketball
              player known for both explosive play on the court and controversy
              away from the game. He became the first great athlete to be
              strongly identified with the hip-hop movement.
            </p>
            <p>
              Athletic success and controversy came to Iverson at an early age.
              At Bethel High School, he led the school’s gridiron football and
              basketball teams to state championships his junior year. At age 17
              he was jailed after being accused of starting a racially charged
              awl in a bowling alley, but his conviction was later overturned
              because of lack of evidence. He was offered a scholarship to
              Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., where in two years he
              averaged 23 points per game and won two Big East Conference
              Defensive Player of the Year awards before making the decision to
              leave school to play professionally. Iverson was chosen first
              overall in the 1996 National Basketball Association (NBA) draft by
              the Philadelphia 76ers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although he was one of the smallest players in the league,
              standing 6 feet (1.8 metres) tall and weighing 165 pounds (75 kg),
              Iverson immediately made a big splash, leading his team with a
              scoring average of 23.5 points per game and winning Rookie the
              Year honours. His quickness and his signature crossover dribble
              often left even the best defenders helpless. Off the court his
              baggy clothing, flashy jewelry, and braided hair were not part of
              the image the NBA wanted to promote. During his early years in the
              league, he clashed frequently with coaches and team officials, was
              portrayed by the media as a selfish, disruptive player, and had
              several run-ins with the law. Yet he developed a huge following of
              young fans who identified with his rebellious image. Despite the
              controversies that followed him, Iverson proved his talent on the
              court, taking the league scoring title in 1998–99 and winning the
              scoring title, the steals title, and Most Valuable Player honours
              in 2000–01 while guiding the 76ers to the NBA finals.
